>> The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms that are individually encapsulated and interchangeable. 
> The desired algorithm can thus be executed at runtime.


>>Application examples:
    • Save document/graphic in different formats
    • Sorting of collections
    • Validations


>> ADVANTAGES:
    • Extensibility
    • Algorithms can be changed at runtime
    • Algorithms are encapsulated in their own classes
