>> The observer pattern is used to define a dependency between one and any number of other objects, 
> such that a change in the state of one object causes all dependent objects to be automatically notified and updated.

>> Application examples:
    • Newsletter
    • Facebook post tracking
    • WhatsApp group
    • Graphical elements of a user interface

>> ADVANTAGES: 
    • State Consistency
    • Observers can be added or removed at any time
    • Subjects and observers are loosely coupled

>> DISADVANTAGES:
    . High number of observers
    . Subject's source code does not show which observers are informed exactly
