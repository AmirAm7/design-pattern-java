>>The decorator pattern provides a flexible alternative to subclassing to extend a class with additional functionality.

>>Purpose:
> You use this pattern when you add certain classes flexibly at runtime want to expand functionality.

>>ADVANTAGES:
> Excessive class hierarchies are avoided 
> Less maintenance 
> Dynamism and flexibility

>>DISADVANTAGES:
> Call of a base functionality has to be executed twice (decorator is just a wrapper)
